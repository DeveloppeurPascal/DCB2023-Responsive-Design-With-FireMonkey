Source codes, links and documents related to the presentation given by [Patrick Prémartin](https://fr.gravatar.com/patrickpremartinfr) during the [LearnDelphi Coding Bootcamp 2023](https://learndelphi.org/coding-bootcamp-2023/) conference.

## Presentation

The pages of this presentation are available in English.

You can view them [as images](./slides) or [download a PDF](HowToCreateAResponsiveDesignInAFireMonkeyApplication-202308.pdf).

Two webinars were offered in 2019 in French on the same theme:
* **Adaptive interfacing with FireMonkey** to be viewed on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr/webinaire-20190528.php) or [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-t0ki__TcrU)
* **Adaptive interface with VCL** to be viewed on [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/webinaire-20190625.php) or [YouTube](https://youtu.be/BE6rjsXHOI8)

YouTube versions benefit from automatic subtitling and sometimes automatic translation. Not always great to watch again, but you should be able to follow along if need be.

## Replays

You can (re)watch the presentation on the [LearnDelphi.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnDelphi) or on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr/learndelphiorg-coding-bootcamp-2023.html) in a few days.

A short version (without demo) of the presentation and the individual videos will also be made available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DeveloppeurPascal) and [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) or [Apprendre Delphi](https://apprendre-delphi.fr). Follow this code repository to be informed when the videos go online: the video addresses will be indicated here.
